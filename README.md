## Snake Game ##

Snake Game is a classic video game where the player maneuvers a growing line around a playing field to eat food while avoiding collisions with itself and the edges. This project will use Python programming language and functional programming principles, with built-in modules such as "random" and "turtle" for food generation and graphics.

The game will feature a basic user interface in functional programming, the game's state is represented by immutable objects, such as a tuple for the snake's position, length, and direction. Functions will update the state based on user input. The game loop will continue to update the state and redraw the screen until the game ends. The score is based on the number of foods eaten, and the game-over screen displays the player's score. This project demonstrates the author's understanding of Python's functional programming and game development abilities without using external libraries or frameworks.
